/**
 * Mocks here (in src, as opposed to test) can be used in beans.xml
 * to create unusual configurations in order to help demos
 * or as temporary workarounds for external system outages.
 * For example, if bsp or the quote server is having a bad
 * day and you can't fix it, maybe you need a mock from
 * here to quickly fix your problem so you can get
 * back to coding.
 *
 * If you have mocks that are used only for
 * automated tests, please don't put them here.
 * Put them in src/test.
 *
 * In the production deployment, this entire package should
 * probably be excluded from the war.
