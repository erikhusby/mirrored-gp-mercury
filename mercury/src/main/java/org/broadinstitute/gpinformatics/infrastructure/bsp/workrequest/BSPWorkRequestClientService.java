/**
 * Common code for BSP service clients for working with various types of BSP work requests.
 *
 * This is currently used as both a parent class for
 * {@link org.broadinstitute.gpinformatics.infrastructure.bsp.plating.BSPPlatingRequestServiceImpl} and as a dependency
 * for {@link BSPKitRequestService}. Eventually, it should probably be a dependency for both classes, which should help
 * to make each easier to test. However, as more functionality is extracted from BSPPlatingRequestServiceImpl into this
 * class, keeping it as a parent class makes the refactoring convenient. Once all of the actual web service client code
 * has been extracted, BSPPlatingRequestServiceImpl can use this class as a dependency instead of a parent class.
